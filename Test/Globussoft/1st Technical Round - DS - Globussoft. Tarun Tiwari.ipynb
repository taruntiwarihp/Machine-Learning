    "Alice: “Let’s just use a very simple code: We’ll assign ‘A’ the code word 1, ‘B’ will be 2, and so\n",
    "on down to ‘Z’ being assigned 26.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob: “That’s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ‘BEAN’ encoded as 25114. You\n",
    "could decode that in many different ways!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice: “Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than ‘BEAN’, you’d get ‘BEAAD’,\n",
    "‘YAAD’, ‘YAN’, ‘YKD’ and ‘BEKD’. I think you would be able to figure out the correct\n",
    "decoding. And why would you send me the word ‘BEAN’ anyway?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob: “OK, maybe that’s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000 there\n",

    "degrees inclusive, and the initial velocity of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the velocity component\n",
